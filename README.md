# Excel-to-Plain-Text
A simple program turns Excel to objects in python and print out results. This can only work for the specific car program, where the columns of the excel file fit the __init__ part.

The excel test.py is the one you should run. It will ask you for a file path, click on the finder UI to select. 
(Partly finished. The program can run, but not on everyone's computer, since we need to download python and pandas and etc. to run)
